//! `engine run --once --work <sandbox>` — the engine's FIRST real end-to-end orchestration of
//! ONE cohort/phase (task T-109), driven strictly over a **sandbox** `.work` handed in as
//! `--work <dir>` and never against a live repository `.work`.
//!
//! This is where the primitives built up by the spike and the T-103…T-107 layers are finally
//! *composed* into a control loop, but only in the hermetic sandbox `tools/harness.ps1` builds:
//!
//! 1. **Lease.** Take the engine's owner lease (role `engine`) through [`crate::lease`] /
//!    `tools/state-tx.ps1` (never a direct lock write, never `--force`; K-003), heartbeat it on
//!    every step boundary, and release it on completion OR error (no dangling owner lease).
//! 2. **Cohort open.** Read a control-plane [`Snapshot`], admit ready, non-overlapping candidates
//!    via the T-106 [`plan_admission`] resolver, and COMMIT the decision transactionally —
//!    `tools/queue-tx.ps1 capture` for each admitted task and the cohort admission transition
//!    validated by `tools/state-tx.ps1 check-transition --kind cohort` — never by hand-editing the
//!    queue / control-plane state.
//! 3. **One execution round.** For each captured task, run ONE supervised leaf call — the
//!    deterministic, offline `__fake-agent` stand-in by default, OR (opt-in `--live`, task T-244)
//!    the REAL `claude -p`/`codex exec` child routed through the executor resolvers — parse its
//!    structured report with [`crate::contract`], apply the T-105
//!    per-task decision (reviewer tier via [`base_reviewer`]), validate the descriptor status
//!    transition through `state-tx check-transition --kind task`, write the descriptor, and emit
//!    the round/task events through `tools/outbox.ps1` in the §19 outbox format.
//! 4. **Per-task review fix cycle (opt-in, `--review`).** After the execution round, every task
//!    that reached `in-review` enters the phase-2.4…2.9 review fix cycle: the base reviewer tier is
//!    picked by [`base_reviewer`] and the concrete reviewer by [`reelect_reviewer`], a supervised
//!    reviewer stand-in writes the task's `review.md`, [`crate::contract::parse_review`] parses it,
//!    and [`review_gate`] names the branch. A **clean** pass promotes `in-review -> ready`;
//!    **findings** dispatch a supervised deterministic coder fix round and RE-REVIEW, looping under
//!    [`review_cycle_decision`] (`REVIEW_LOOP_MAX`); an **incomplete** pass re-runs the reviewer
//!    unchanged (phase 2.7). Exhausting the cycle budget is a CLEAN terminal escalation
//!    (`in-review -> escalated`, `не сходится ревью после N циклов`) through the SAME
//!    `state-tx check-transition` + `queue-tx escalate` path the execution round uses — never a
//!    re-interpretation. Every cycle transition is validated through `state-tx check-transition`
//!    before the descriptor is written, is recorded on the descriptor as `Циклов-ревью: N`, and is
//!    emitted through `tools/outbox.ps1` keyed by the cycle number (so each cycle is a DISTINCT
//!    observable fact by fingerprint). The phase is off by default so the T-109 execution-only
//!    baseline (which stops at `in-review`) is unchanged.
//! 5. **Join barrier (opt-in, `--join`, implies `--review`; task T-243).** After the review round
//!    promotes the ready tasks, drive `agents/processor.md` phases 4–6 in the SAME hermetic
//!    sandbox: enter the join (integration `none -> in-progress`, `cohort.join_started`), merge the
//!    ready branches sequentially through a supervised `merger` stand-in whose `merge_report.md`
//!    the engine decides off ([`crate::contract::parse_merge_report`]) — `ready -> merged` per
//!    merged branch, `ready -> conflict` + `queue-tx return` per quarantined one — then run the
//!    bounded integration review cycle (a supervised `full_reviewer` stand-in + [`integration_gate`]
//!    over `F-`/`SUMMARY-F`, capped by `INTEGRATION_LOOP_MAX` via the SAME [`review_cycle_decision`]
//!    as the per-task cycle). A converged review publishes (integration `reviewed -> published`,
//!    each task `merged -> published`, `cohort.published`) and archives (`published -> done`,
//!    `queue-tx archive`, integration `published -> cleaned`); a non-converged one STOPS unpublished
//!    (integration `-> failed`, tasks stay `merged`). One `cohort.closed` terminally processes the
//!    cohort in every case. Every integration transition is validated through
//!    `state-tx check-transition --kind integration` before it is written; the merge/publish is
//!    hermetically SIMULATED (the sandbox `.work` has no repository — no live VCS mutation). Off by
//!    default so the T-127/T-128 review baseline (which stops at `ready`) is unchanged.
//!
//! **Boundaries this module keeps.** It touches ONLY the `.work` passed as `--work` (the run
//! subcommand has NO default work dir, so it can never silently resolve the repo's live `.work`);
//! it CALLS `tools/*.ps1` as they are and never edits them; every mutation of the queue / lease /
//! outbox goes through those transactional tools; and it is not wired into `agents/processor.md`
//! or any launcher. It is exercised by `engine run --once` and the hermetic `run_fixture` /
//! `review_fixture` / `join_fixture` e2e tests.
